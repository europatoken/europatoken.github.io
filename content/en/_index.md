# The Myth of Europa

Once upon a time, so Greek mythology tells us, a beautiful young woman called Europa spied a white bull, strange and otherworldly, among her father’s herd. What wonders could it show her, she wondered? Climbing on its back, she was whisked away across the sea, to a new life of wondrous glory and intrigue: for she had ridden the constellation of Taurus, and her life would never be the same.

Far into the solar system, circling the red giant, the planet Europa carries a deep and abiding mystery. Its icy crust, smoother than any other object in our Solar, suggests a hidden ocean whose watery depths may harbour life unlike any we can imagine on earth.
Whether Greek myth or modern-day scientific mystery, Europa represents a deep yearning: to explore the universe around us and find our place in the stars.

# The Reality of $Europa

And so, $Europa was born with a mission: to inspire the world to love and value space exploration.

$Europa is a unique opportunity to use Digital Finance to facilitate breathtaking real world experiences that foster people’s sense of wonder about the world beyond our planet: trips to space camp, tours of space museums, and access to ground-breaking institutions like NASA. One day, $Europa might allow everyone to experience space flight for themselves. We are also aiming to have a $Europa NFT included in NASA’s mission to Europa in 2024.Truly the sky is no limit!

# The Community of $Europa

To reach beyond the globe, we believe that it will take a community spread across the globe.

100% community owned, $Europa believes that just as it was the effort and belief of the world that led to the Moon missions, it is the effort and belief of our community that will make us great.

As a result, $Europa will be managed by listening to those who hold our tokens, through deep and honest engagement. But it’s not all about listening: action is built into the fabric of $Europa.

A strong community is built on passionate people who stay and engage, and so 3% of every transaction returns to our token holders to recognise and celebrate everyone who is with us for the long haul. 

Listening to our community is nothing if we can’t act on their opinions! So, 4% of every transaction goes into the Ocean: a pool of funds for the benefit of the $Europa community. Whether they believe that these funds should be used for advertising, buybacks, burns, donations, or something else, we commit to listening and acting with and for them, so that we can all steward $Europa together.

To help us grow our community, we plan giveaways as our community grows: once the total number of holders reaches each threshold, everyone can share in the celebration! Look out for tokens, NFTs, real world experiences and more as our community grows. We plan celebrations at 2500, 5000, 10k, 50k, and 100k  total token holders.
